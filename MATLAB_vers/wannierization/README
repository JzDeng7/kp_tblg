Reduced model Hamiltonians and MATLAB scripts for generating the models from k-dot-p theory

Summary of subdirectories:

==== ./hmat_archive/

  Stores Hamiltonians, includes MATLAB scripts for viewing band structure.
  Note that the Wannier Functions are NOT saved, for memory constraints.
  Use the "tblg_wan_run" scripts in the 8band or 5band directory to generate them locally.

==== ./8band/

  For generating the 8-band model, including effects of external field and substate perturbations.

==== ./5band/

  For generating both the "top" and "bot" 5-band models and their Wannier Functions

==== ./projection_tools/

  Stores MATLAB functions needed for the multi-step projection technique
