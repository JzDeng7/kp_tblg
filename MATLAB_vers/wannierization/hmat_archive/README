Reduced model Hamiltonians and MATLAB scripts for bandstructure

Summary of files:

==== band_demo.m

   Generates band-structure for a given model and twisting-angle.
   8band model : 0.60 to 1.30 degrees, in 0.05 degree increments.
   5band models: 0.85 to 1.30 degrees, in 0.05 degree increments.
   [UNTESTED]: Can likely interpolate between the given twisting angles...?

==== bands_from_hmat_asci.m

   Function for generating high-symm band structure from given hmat file
   Can be checked to get conventions for the hamiltonian data-files.

Summary of subdirectories:

==== ./hmat_2019-07-11/

   8-band and 5-band Hamiltonians based on the paper: [arXiv link coming]
   Defines:
       H_mn(R_x,R_y) = t_real + i * t_cpx
   Data structure (in .dat files):    
        R_x    R_y    m    n    t_real    t_cpx
