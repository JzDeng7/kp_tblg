Reduced model Hamiltonians and MATLAB scripts for bandstructure

Summary of files:

==== tblg_wan_run.m

    Performs the Wannier projection technique and REWAN step,
    saving all hamiltonian and Wannier function files in a directory.

==== perturb_tests.m

    Computes effects of external perturbation (electric displacement field,
    substrate symm breaking onsite terms). Can plot resulting \Delta H both
    before and after the REWAN step, as well as band structures.

==== wf_spread_and_viewer.m

    For checking WF spread, can also view the WFs in 2D, with layer and
    sublattice projections.

==== wf_symm_viewer.m

    For explicitly checking if the Wannier Functions satisfy C3, Mx, and C2T
    The REWAN Wannier Functions have a "rephasing" which makes them behave
    like more conventional "s", "pz" and "p+-" orbitals.

==== "Everything-else.m"
    
    Functions and utilities needed for the above 4 scripts.
    These have less comprehensive documentation (can email questions),
