MATLAB version of the relaxed k-dot-p mod
Should agree with C++/Python version if using same data file...

Summary of files:

==== Main Functions:

tblg_kp_calc_ext.m:
  Creates kp Hamiltonians at desired thetas, then 
  returns list of eigenvalues and k-pts.
  Can be used for band-structure and fermi velocity calculations,
  and results can be passed to interp_kp_dos.m for DoS calculation.

interp_kp_dos.m:
  Can be passed eigenvalues from ("full_bz",1) runs of tblg_kp_calc_ext.m
  Uses a finite elements method to accurately reconstruct the DoS/IDoS
  and returns {E,DoS,IDoS} sets for each passed "full_bz" dataset.

==== Utility Functions:

parse_datafile.m:
  Reads datafile for use in tblg_kp_calc_ext.m

generate_k_line.m:
  Simple tool to get proper sampling and scaling of line-cut
  through the BZ for bandstructure calculations

==== Utility Scripts:

kp_terms_plotter.m:
  Loads data file and looks at theta dependence of various 
  kp terms (for paper, in preparation as of March 1st 2019).
